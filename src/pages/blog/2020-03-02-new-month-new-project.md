So firstly, exciting news: the Alexa skill made the cut and is now on the store. So that's a good way to finish that project off!

Now, though, it's the beginning of another month, so that means I need to find something new to make! January was a web project, February was voice, so it's about time to tackle something mobile. I don't yet have any apps published in either the Google Play or Apple App stores, so I think it's about time to get something into each of them. I could develop two separate apps for this, but there's a lovely framework called Flutter that will let me kill two birds with one stone. So that's what this month will be: a flutter app.

# The concept

Making a to do list, or some other sort of simple project would certainly be possible, but let's get a bit more ambitious, shall we? I want to build something that will provide value, as well as teach me some new skills. I want to make something that will take advantage of the mobile nature of the app, and the capabilities of the device it's on. So, I'm thinking I'll use the camera to do some optical character recognition, in order to solve sudoku live on screen. I'm not sure exactly how I will tackle this yet, since I am very much a beginner with computer vision, but hopefully by the end of the month, I'll have an app that can do that.

The overall idea though, is that the user will open up their device and point the camera at a sudoku square. The app will locate the boundaries of the square, figure out the numbers already on the board, and then solve the sudoku, placing characters in the empty squares. Additionally, as extended functionality, it would be good to have the app recognise when hand written numbers are incorrect, and show those in red. 

# Fallbacks

Last month, I realised the necessity of having something as a fall back, in case the original plan is too difficult. So this month, I'm going to have some put in place already, so I don't need to waste time coming up with a new idea if the first one doesn't work out... 

I want to stick to the theme of mobile apps, and still want to keep it more challenging than just following along with a tutorial. I'm thinking perhaps an app that will get 7 recipes for the week, along with creating a shopping list, so the user can get everything they need and cook dinners. I figure this should be possible with a recipe API or database online, and some storage on the device to keep the 7 recipes for offline viewing. 

\---

There's the plan. A mobile app of some description, made in a month. It might be sudoku and computer vision, or it might be a little bit more simple. Either way, I'll learn some cool new stuff, and have something up in the app stores by the end of the month.
