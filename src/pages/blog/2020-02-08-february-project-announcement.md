Last month, I managed to sneak in a project just in time. I got this website up and running, even if it didn’t look too pretty. Slowly, I’ve been tinkering with it, but now it’s time to get into the February project.

# What is it?

This month, I’m tackling a project that I’ve had ongoing for a few years: a photo archive. I am a life member of the Monash Cheerleading Club, and I figured a good way to give back for all the years it gave me would be to have an online archive of all the competition photos that have been compiled over the years. \
\
Previously, I have spent time collecting as many of the photos as I could, and I put up a placeholder “coming soon” page, but never really got into making the actual archive. So, what better time than now, towards the start of the year, so that all the new members joining this year can see what the club is about, and returning members can relive their glory days.

# How it will be made

I am still deciding exactly how to make the project, but I have an old computer laying around at home I plan to use for the hosting server, so I don’t have to shell out every month to host the photos. Since this is a project that is done out of the goodness of my own spirit, and not to make money, it needs to be as cheap as possible, especially with ongoing costs. 

Since this will be a full stack project, there will need to be a trade off of experimentation and known processes. I plan to use Angular on the front end, since it’s the framework I’m most familiar with, and will save me time to not learn something new. On the back end, however, I plan to experiment with a GraphQL server. I haven’t used it before, so this will provide an opportunity to learn a new piece of technology. 

As for the rest of the project, I will update throughout the month regarding the decisions that are made in order to hopefully have the archives fully functional by the end of the month.
