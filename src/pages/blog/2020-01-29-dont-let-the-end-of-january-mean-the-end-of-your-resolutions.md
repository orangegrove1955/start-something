  Just because the month is coming to an end, doesn't mean it has to be the same
  for your resolutions. Think back to this time only a month ago, regain that

It's easy to get distracted from what you were wanting to do at the start of the year, especially now that the next month is looming. All those things you thought would happen over the holiday break didn't quite pan out, and your motivation is waning. But don't let that get into your head! Just try to remember how you felt back when the turn of the decade was upon us, and bring that exhiliration back!

# My Plan to keep things going

I realised today that although I had set some lofty goals, and had already achieved some, I was losing steam. I could feel myself dropping back into old habits, which is not what I want to be doing, so I figured it's time to get out of my head, and into my plans.

 At the start of the year, I set myself a challenge to make something new every month, for 12 months. I actually managed to achieve that this month, by setting up a shopify store to learn how it worked. I realised, though, that while I had learned a lot from that experience, I hadn't actually launched the store, and hadn't made it public.

It's absolutely necessary to keep your goals evolving over time. Otherwise, you stagnate, and feel like nothing is any different from the days before. So, I'm revising my goal. Rather than just making 12 things and keeping them to myself, I am going to make 12 things, and share them with the world. 

# My first project

If you haven't guessed it already, then surprise! It's actually this website. I read about Netlify CMS and Gatsby last year, but never actually got around to using them for anything other than starting the beginner site and playing around with a few settings. Now, with my new goal in mind, it's the perfect time to learn a few new skills. 

I think the thing that's most exciting about this first project, is that it serves so many purposes. Not only will it provide me a place to learn Netlify CMS and Gatsby, but it will also serve as a conduit for so much more. I will have to polish up my writing skills over time. I'll need to figure out how to make a blog look good visually. SEO is an obvious necessity, since this is meant to be seen by as many people as possible, and as the saying goes:

"The best place to hide a dead body is page 2 of Google"

# The pitfalls of doing too much at once

One of the reasons I set myself a goal of only one project per month is that I know burnout is a strong possibility. Going from 0-100 in just a few days is not sustainable at all. So, I've set myself a challenge that I think is a much more reasonable goal. Will it be easy? No, and that's the entire point. I'm trying to learn, and experience, and grow, not to have a walk in the park. 

That being said, I realise that this website itself is going to be a mammoth task. Trying to learn about how to set up and run a blog will be challenging enough, let alone finding things to write about. Hopefully though, the lessons I learn from the setup will be able to become the content, at least for a while. With that in mind, I am again going to set a few limits. I want to write something once a week, and stick to that pace. 

If I get a few article ideas at once, I will write them out, sure, but not post them. Building a backlog is something I intuitively feel will be important, especially for the weeks that are exhaustingly busy. So, keeping that backlog of articles, just in case, should hopefully get me through the rest of 2020, and hopefully beyond.

# That's it, let's get started

I know I'm squeezing this in just in time to be still count as a January project, but oh well, better late than never. Hopefully, by the time you're reading this, I will have also finished the site design, and published a few more articles. Hopefully, those articles will be a better standard than this slapped together thing, and I will continue to improve in the future. 

And finally, hopefully you've made it here through some SEO, or a link from another one of my posts, and you've enjoyed what you've read. I'm glad I could share it with you, and I look forward to sharing even more in the future.
