  Sometimes, keeping up with what you planned to do becomes hard. But you've got
  to keep on going anyway, even without the momentum

Life can be hard sometimes. Especially when you have an ambitious goal that you want to achieve. It's always much easier to just give up on things, rather than keep going. But keep going you must, in order to achieve greatness. There are always many paths to success, so even though you might not be able to make it there the original way you chose, it doesn't mean you can't make it there at all.

This week was very unproductive in terms of my own personal goal to create something by the end of the month. The project might have been too ambitious, my focus might have been elsewhere; there are a number of things I could come up with as excuses, but really, all that matters is I need to find a new way.

The ultimate goal is this: finish a public facing project by the end of the month. That gives me just under a week. So, I guess I could keep working on the archives, and try to push through, learning all sorts of new things, and potentially missing the deadline. Or, I could use what I've learned working on the project, and make something smaller scale.

# Where to from here

I still want to achieve my goals, I'm not giving up on them. Which means I need to have something put together by the end of the month. That's not very long at all to come up with a new idea, and get it fully built, so the overall scope of the project might not be particularly large.

The size of the project doesn't really matter that much though, the main thing is being able to have something finished and presentable by the end of the month. I could potentially finish a previous project that I have started, or come up with something from scratch, I'm not quite sure yet. 

What I do know is that by the end of the month, I will have achieved SOMETHING, and that's the whole point of this endeavour. Make new things. Try new techniques. Learn. I suppose in the end, the real goal is just to become more involved and productive, so even if I end up with a single page website by the end of the month, that's more than existed at the start of it.

I plan to do two posts next week: one right at the beginning, after I've put some thought in over the weekend and decided what to do, and another at the end of the month, showing off the final state. 

There are 8 days left, to get it all sorted and completed, so here's looking forward to a busy 8 days, starting something, and then finishing it.
