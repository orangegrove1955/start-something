We're halfway through February now, and things are coming along. There has been some progress on the project, in terms of building a backend and a frontend. Primarily, work has been focused on the API, rather than the frontend implementation. There's still a lot of work to do, but here's where things are at for now

# Front end

The front end is being built with Angular, but for the most part, there has been very little progress this week. A simple Netlify page, linked to a subdomain, gives the view shown in the leading picture of this article. This is just a simple, single page component built to have a placeholder for when the backend is more functional. So, essentially, the front end progress is linking a subdomain to Netlify. 

# Back end

Now, this is where some serious work has gone in. Not only have I had to link the API subdomain, I've had to set up a physical server to host it, and create an Express server to run on that to actually distribute the files.

## Physical server

I had an old media computer lying around at home, not doing much, so I figured it would be the perfect opportunity to learn how to host your own server at home, rather than paying a monthly fee to use AWS or GCP. 

## Express.js
