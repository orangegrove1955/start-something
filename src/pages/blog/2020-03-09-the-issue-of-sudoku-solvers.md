There has been very little development progress since last week on the Sudoku solving app. This is due to the fact that I had assumed there would be pre-existing Dart code to use to solve the Sudoku problems that could simply be dropped into the project, leaving me plenty of time to work on the interface and OCR aspects of development.

I'm sad to say, that unfortunately, Google only provides one result showing Dart based Sudoku algorithms, and the repo is from 7 years ago. The code is too outdated for my system to run, so I have had a bit of conundrum. As such, a lot of this week was dedicated to learning about Sudoku solving algorithms, so that hopefully I will be able to implement my own over the next few days, to use in the app.

I must say, I'm rather surprised there is only one result on Google, so I will definitely be creating a Github repo for the code, as I'm sure I'm not the first person to want to solve Sudoku with Flutter. When searching Google for that, though, it seems like again, not many people have had this idea and followed through with it. I'm excited to potentially be one of the first to create an app like this, even though it does mean it will be harder without anyone to guide me.

Still, a challenge is a challenge, and I'm keen to keep cracking on. This next week will hopefully see the creation of a Dart based Sudoku solving algorithm, which will possibly have an accompanying Medium story, because it seems like it's something that is not very widespread on the internet. Who knows, I might even create a Youtube video about it as well, just to share some more knowledge, and potentially kick start a new personal project in addition to my writing: videos.

For now though, the focus is just getting this app built. That starts with the Sudoku algorithm, and then an app to wrap it up in. Then comes OCR with a standard grid output, then near-real time OCR and augmented video feed display. Still so much to do, the videos and articles can wait.
